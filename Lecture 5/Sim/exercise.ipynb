You can define the state as the position and velocity of the biker, and use the output of mean shift or cam shift (or a detection method of your choice) for the measurement update (note: we only measure position!). You will need to define a measurement matrix, a state transition matrix (motion model), as well as covariance matrices for the measurement and process (model) noise. You can start with unit matrices, and experiment with the parameters.\n",
