    "## Exercise 3 - Stereo calibration & rectification\n",
    "So far we have relied on already rectified images and pre-calibrated cameras. But let us try to do both this calibration and rectification on our own! This can be done using OpenCV's \"stereoCalibrate(...)\"-function which relies on paired stereo images of a checkerboard in order to perform the calibration. You can download the \"get started\"-script along with the checkerboard images here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Carry out the actual stereo calibration. What is the resulting baseline (i.e. distance between the two stereo cameras) according to the calibration?\n",
    "* If we look at a pair of the stereo images used for the calibration (e.g. \"left01.jpg\" and \"right01.jpg\") is it clear that they are not rectified. Try to rectify them (just a single pair is fine) and plot the result. (hint: look at the \"stereoRectify(...)\"-function used earlier in exercise 2 and the subsequent remapping of the images)\n",
    "* Save the fundamental matrix for next exercise! (write it to a file or just do a copy & paste...)"
