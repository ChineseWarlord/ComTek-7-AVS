<ins>**Submission Guidelines**</ins>  
    1. Who to submit?
    One and only one member of a group should submit the exercise solution on behalf of
    the group.

    2. What to submit?
    A submission is a single ZIP-file with the following naming convention:
    "Lecture_<lecture_number>_<group_id>.zip", where <lecture_number> is taken
    from moodle and <group_id> contains three digits randomly assigned by you and
    should be greater than 123 and smaller than 999. <group_id> should be kept the same
    through the course.

    3. What to include?
    The following things should ALWAYS be included in the submitted ZIP-file:
    • Lecture_<lecture_number>_<group_id>.<m/py> : The main script to run. As
    an example if a group with ID 888 submits a Matlab file for Lecture number 8
    the main script should be called Lecture_8_888.m. A mandatory header
    should be provided in the top (see section 2 .1).
    • Lecture_<lecture_number>_<group_id>.pdf: Pdf file containing results,
    comments, discussion etc., if any, provided by the group (see section 2 .2).
    • data/: Folder containing any data used (e.g., images, data sets etc.). However,
    do not include any data that are given by the exercise.
    If additionally custom functions are used which are in separate files, these files should
    be located in the root of the ZIP-folder.

        3.1 Code Header
        The following code should be used as a mandatory header and placed at the top in the
        main script, i.e., Lecture_<lecture_number>_<group_id>.<m/py> .

        See Submission_Template.py
    
    3.2 Summary of results
    A summary of the results should be included separately in a pdf-file. This file can
    contain (but is not limited to) accuracy/error-rate, plots, comments, and discussions.
    There is no strict requirement here, but as a general rule the summary should convey
    the results etc. without having to read or run the actual code.
